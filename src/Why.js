                Integritee enables developers and firms to process sensitive data,
                without compromising on privacy. Our platform combines the trust
                of blockchain with the confidentiality of off-chain, trusted execution
                environments (TEEs). This enables developers and firms to create
                decentralized data-driven apps and services that can securely process
                sensitive data, without revealing it on chain.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Integritee ecosystem, across all instances on Kusama, Polkadot
                and elsewhere, will be powered by our native token, TEER. Backers
                who support our parachain bids by temporarily locking in KSM will
                be rewarded in TEER.
            </p>
            <p>
                We all know the problems with centralized data services. Integritee
                is the solution. Help us build a new internet where privacy comes as standard and earn TEER in the process.
